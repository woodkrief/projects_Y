First Project - Research in the Stream Genre:
Utilizing open sources, historical data on game sales, as well as user and expert ratings, information on genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) was available. The objective was to identify patterns that contribute to a game's success. This would enable strategic investment in potentially popular products and facilitate the planning of advertising campaigns.

Second Project - What Story Can Fry Tell?:
Investors from the "Shut Up and Take My Money" fund, seeking new ventures, decided to explore the culinary world by opening a catering establishment in Moscow. The nature of this establishment is yet undecided; it could be a cafe, restaurant, pizzeria, pub, or bar. Crucial details such as location, menu, and pricing are also yet to be determined. A comprehensive study of the Moscow market was needed to uncover unique insights. The findings will aid in making informed. 

Project's Status: Completed

All findings from the current studies are presented in the final sections of the respective studies.
