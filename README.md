First project - Research in Stream genre.
Based on open sources, historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available. 
It was necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This would allow place a bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

Second project - What story can Fry tell
Investors from the "Shut Up and Take My Money" fund decided to try themselves in a new area and open a catering establishment in Moscow. Customers do not yet know what kind of place it will be: a cafe, restaurant, pizzeria, pub or bar, and what the location, menu and prices will be.
It was necessary to prepare a study of the Moscow market, find interesting features and present the results obtained, which in the future will help in choosing a suitable location for investors.

All findings from the current studies are presented in the final sections of the respective studies.
