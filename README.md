First Project - Research in the Stream Genre:
Utilizing open sources, historical data on game sales, as well as user and expert ratings, information on genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) was available. The objective was to identify patterns that contribute to a game's success. This would enable strategic investment in potentially popular products and facilitate the planning of advertising campaigns.

Second Project - What Story Can Fry Tell?:
Investors from the "Shut Up and Take My Money" fund, seeking new ventures, decided to explore the culinary world by opening a catering establishment in Moscow. The nature of this establishment is yet undecided; it could be a cafe, restaurant, pizzeria, pub, or bar. Crucial details such as location, menu, and pricing are also yet to be determined. A comprehensive study of the Moscow market was needed to uncover unique insights. The findings will aid in making informed. 

Third Project - Metanprombank:
The work was carried out for the product management department of Metanprombank. The bank has recently encountered an increased level of outflow, and would like to find out what is causing this. A full analysis of the provided data was carried out, including exploratory analysis, statistical testing of hypotheses and the construction of visual graphs. As a result, 3 segments of problematic (prone to churn) clients were identified, for which recommendations were given.

Project's Status: Completed

All findings from the current studies are presented in the final sections of the respective studies.
